                            <p>Islam is a universal religion that covers
                            all the aspects of the life for the humanity. It is the religion of true peace
                            and equality. Islam means submission and obedience to will of God. The entire
                            Islam is based upon five pillars. Sadqah means purification in the form of
                            wealth to the needy people.&nbsp;&nbsp; This duty
                            of Muslims has even stated in the Quran for the rich people. It is all about
                            supporting the poor and needy people. It has been rightly said that all the
                            things are in the custody of God and wealth is just in the hands of the human
                            beings as being the trust.&nbsp; In simple
                            words we can even call Sadqah with the name of being growth and purification. </p>
