It was established by Sufi Basafa Nisar Ul Millah Waddin Sufi Nisar Ul Haq Nasqshbandi R.A in Karachi, Pakistan.

<h4>Mast community education program</h4>



<p>We give financial help to students studying for higher education in universities and professional colleges. We also provide possible financial help for girls to get married. Possible medical facilities are provided to the ill people of our locality who are completely helpless. MASWT’s model of education relies upon 7 key pillars</p>

<ol>
    <li>1. Identifying and serving the most needy in our rural community</li>
    <li>2. Focusing on achieving positive outcomes for students</li>
    <li>3. Using buildings and facilities for multiuse reducing resource waste</li>
    <li>4. Providing a gender balance reflecting our student population</li>
    <li>5. Providing nationally recognized quality standards in our delivery of secular and Islamic education</li>
    <li>6. Providing adult literacy support to families of children we serve</li>
    <li>7. Professional management of all our services</li>
</ol>


<p>Education is a neglected field in Pakistan and data shows that primary school enrollment is very low in Pakistan. In addition nearly 30% of children drop out from the 3rd class onward. Generally parents cannot afford to send their children to school. Parents with five to six children cannot afford school fees, books and uniforms. For this reason our provision is either free or substantially subsidized to promote access to education.</p>



<p>The United Nations Development Programme for Pakistan launched its National Human Development Report (NHDR) – Unleashing the potential of a Young Pakistan (2/5/18). It focuses on youth empowerment: quality education, gainful employment and meaningful engagement. MAST is integrating Islamic stiudies with education. We believe that conventional education alone cannot deliver the active and productive citizens of the future. MASWT provides the opportunity to students to learn Arabic and memorize the Quran. Our schools go beyond just education in scripture, we offer an allencompassing Islamic environment for children and young adults to acquire secular education. Our schools aim to instill values and morals in students while delivering an education conscious of Islamic foundations. Faith is increasingly a crucial part of the Pakistani identity and supports the zeal for knowledge and development.</p>


<h4>Medical</h4>

During the period of experience, we happen to see that a number of young boys and girls died at very early age only because they were not properly diagnosed and treated. We have taken this matter very seriously and rush for the treatment and take them to big hospitals where necessary.</p>



<p>MASWT is delivering education in primary (grades 1-5), middle (grades 6-8), high (grades 9-10) leading to the Secondary School Certificate or SSC), and intermediate (grades 11-12), leading to a Higher Secondary School Certificate.</p>

<h4>RO Plant</h4>

We appealed the kind donors to help these people in providing drinking water. Plant is working well and benefiting everyone living in the vicinity. It is a big project of clean drinking water and has been proved very beneficial and healthy source for the community.</p>
