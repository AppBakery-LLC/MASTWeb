                            <p>The Mujaddid Alf Sani Welfare Trust International arrange the Collective Qurbani every year in <b>Azad Kashmir, Multan, Muzaffergarh, Mianwali, Pindighep, Chakwal, Attock and Karachi</b> and distribute the Meat to Orphans, Widows, Less Privileged and needy people.</p>
                            <p>The sacred tradition of Qurbani is an act steeped in significance, yet rich in real-world impact. As we reflect upon the extraordinary sacrifice the great Prophet Ibrahim (as) was willing to make for His Lord, we ponder what true submission means.</p>
                            <p>Giving Qurbani means that you can share the joy of Eid al-Adha with those in need around the world.</p>
